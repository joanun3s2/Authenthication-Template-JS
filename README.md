# Authenthication-Template-JS
An authetication template made in JavaScript using React (Native) and TypeScript.

## Authrn ver 0.1
Actually this application consists of an authentication routine template which means that is has the basics of routes (signed in or not), authentication methods and
and user real time data (just like *jwt* token, user info and so on).

At the actual version, all it does is permiting the user to login and logout (at user side just to screens with a center button).

## Release ver 0.2 incoming improvements
On version 0.2 is expected to be an login and *sign in* form and also an welcome page with a logout button.
The *sign in*, login and logout should work by and **node.js** api on backend as the form is expected to be made using **unform** framework made by ***RocketSeat***.

#### Get it running
To run the application you might have an *Android/IOS* device running (real or emulator) and first get the app working by:

```shell
yarn start
```
After the application is running, you have to install it on your android device by (using another terminal instance):


```shell
yarn android
```

After that, it should be working fine.
